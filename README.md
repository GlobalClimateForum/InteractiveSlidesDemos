A repository containing a demo for the package InteractiveSlides.jl, which can be found [here](https://github.com/GlobalClimateForum/InteractiveSlides.jl). For a quick setup, simply clone the repository, start a Julia session within the folder, activate and instantiate the project[^1], and type "include("startapp.jl")". This will eventually open a browser window with the demo slideshow.

[^1]: Since InteractiveSlides.jl is not yet registered as a Julia package, you'll need to type "dev https://github.com/GlobalClimateForum/InteractiveSlides.jl" in Pkg mode.
