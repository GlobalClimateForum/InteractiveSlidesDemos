A repository containing demos for the package InteractiveSlides.jl, which can be found [here](https://github.com/jochenkrattenmacher/InteractiveSlides.jl). For a quick setup, simply clone the repository, start a Julia session within the folder, activate and instantiate the project, and type include("startapp.jl"). This will eventually open a browser window with the demo slideshow.

During development of a presentation, supply "reset=1" as a URL parameter, e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/?reset=1, in order to update the presentation on each page reload.
